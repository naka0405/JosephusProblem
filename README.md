### JosephusProblem
This was an exercise for NSS C#/.Net backend.

At some point there was a war, and during one of its battles
defendants were blocked by attackers in the cave. To avoid capture they decided to stand in a circle and kill each third until only one person remained. That person was supposed to commit suicide. He eventually decided to just surrender. Apparently this is a real thing that happened and the guy's name was Josephus.

Your task is to write a method called `LastPersonStanding` that, for a given number of people `numberOfPeople` and killing interval `killingInterval`, determines the position of the person who remains alive... the Josephus position.
